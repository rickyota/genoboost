I'm happy to announce that Linfa finally gets its own website. We are currently trying to improve the documentation in various places and a website should serve as a starting point for anyone interested in Linfa.

The [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) project offers an excellent static page generator. It was easy to setup, customize and powerful enough for our usecase. A big kudos to the developer over there! We also integrated it into our CI system for a continuous publication of the website and its announcements.

In the future we may publish a markdown book on Statistical/Machine learning algorithms, but this may be a bit far fetched right now. If you are interested in what we are doing, say hello at [Zulip](https://rust-ml.zulipchat.com).
